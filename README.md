## Communication Protcol 

Group members have been assigned 2 variations of each question to accurately and efficiently analyze data.
Group members will meet via Zoom 1 time per week minimum outside of class, 2 if scheduling permits.
Each person will loop in the rest of the group on their achievements and completed tasks via project group in Slack.
Slack channel for the group will also be a place for any questions that arise during the week.
Group will work collaboratively during class times each week and ensure all data is accurate and troubleshoot where needed.


## Our Why:
Group selected this particular topic because it is relevant to the coursework and incorporates the information Prof Norman went over at the beginning of each topic. Salary matters in each field, and knowing what we are looking at is beneficial to all of us as we explore data science careers.
